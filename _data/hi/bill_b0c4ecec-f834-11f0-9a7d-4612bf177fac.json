Reduces the maximum amount of a late charge for unpaid rent from 8% of the unpaid amount to 5% of the unpaid amount.  Specifies that if rent is increased, the landlord may also proportionately increase the amount due as a security deposit; provided that a continuing or renewing tenant shall have at least 30 days to pay the additional amount due.

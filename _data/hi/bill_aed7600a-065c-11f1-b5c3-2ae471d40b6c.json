Authorizes the DLNR to relax any restrictions and stringent standards on a dam or appurtenance upon verification of certain insurance coverage.  Authorizes the DLNR to consider a dam, reservoir, or appurtenance is safe absent certain documents.  Shifts the burden of proof to the DLNR to find that a dam is categorized as high-hazard.

Amends the aggregate liability limit for qualifying damages from covered catastrophic wildfires to be $1,000,000,000, rather than administratively established by the Public Utilities Commission, and makes the limit applicable only to property covered by a property insurance policy up to the coverage limit.  Requires the Director of Emergency Management to determine whether a wildfire is a covered catastrophic wildfire.  Specifies that claims subject to the limit must be filed within one year of the covered catastrophic wildfire.  Clarifies that a property and casualty insurer's rights to subrogation are not limited in the context of an insured's recovery by judgment or settlement of a third-party tort claim."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Prefiled.", "date": "2026-01-20", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "MATAYOSHI", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"name\": \"MATAYOSHI\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "HB1638", "links": [{"url": "https://data.capitol.hawaii.gov/sessions/session2026/bills/HB1638_.HTM", "media_type": "text/html"}, {"url": "https://data.capitol.hawaii.gov/sessions/session2026/bills/HB1638_.PDF", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://capitol.hawaii.gov/session/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&billnumber=1638&year=2026", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:hi/government", "name": "Hawaii", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:hi"}, "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T08:31:08+00:00", "_id": "06cc35e2-fdb6-11f0-b156-fef38faa1582"}
